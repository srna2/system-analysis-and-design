# Online Cinema Reservation

# Project Purpose and business need: 
To provide customers to buy tickets wherever they’re located, to reserve seats they want and to promote the film publicity through internet. To escape wasting precious time at the counter hall of the cinema, waiting in line, and ending up getting unwanted seats or maybe even not getting tickets at all. Also, if you book tickets earlier, however you realize you can’t go, simply cancel and get a refund.
